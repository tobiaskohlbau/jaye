# JAYE

JAYE is just another YouTube extractor which serves my purposes and maybe yours. Use the `docker-compose.dev.yml` to get started. I created this project cause I hate to install software on my machine only to extract a podcast from YouTube. JAYE is split into two parts, backend and frontend. Whereas the backend part is realized in go the frontend uses angular 2.

# Getting Started 

Use the file `docker-compose.yml` as a reference to launch and use JAYE.
